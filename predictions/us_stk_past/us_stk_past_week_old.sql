-- Usage: @us_stk_past_week.sql 2011-05-02

-- I use this script to get 1 week's worth of us_stk-prediction data.
-- This script depends on tables created by us_stk_past.sql
-- So, I should run us_stk_past.sql before I run us_stk_past_week.sql

-- Start by showing summarized data for each tkr:

COLUMN tkr FORMAT A8  HEADING  'Stock|Ticker'
COLUMN avg_tkr_price    FORMAT 9999.99  HEADING 'Avg|Ticker|Price|at Hour 0'
COLUMN avg_danbot_score FORMAT 9.99    HEADING 'Avg|DanBot|Score|at Hour 0'
COLUMN sharpe_ratio     FORMAT 9999.99 HEADING 'Sharpe|Ratio'  
COLUMN avg_24hr_gain    FORMAT 999.99  HEADING 'Avg|24hr|Gain'
COLUMN position_count   FORMAT 99999   HEADING 'Count of|positions'  
COLUMN sum_24hr_gain    FORMAT 99999.99 HEADING 'Sum of|24hr gains'   
COLUMN avg_1hr_gain     FORMAT 999.99  HEADING 'Avg|1hr|Gain'
COLUMN stddev_24hr_gain FORMAT 999.99 HEADING 'Standard|Deviation|of 24hr gains'
