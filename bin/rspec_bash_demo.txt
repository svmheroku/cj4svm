rspec_bash_demo.txt

Peter,

Here is an example of a simple shell script:

https://github.com/svmheroku/cj4svm/blob/522655301f4a7be854c53a45baa28d432bd8cc86/bin/rspec_bash_demo.bash

Here is an example of an rspec script which does the same thing:

https://github.com/svmheroku/cj4svm/blob/522655301f4a7be854c53a45baa28d432bd8cc86/bin/rspec_bash_demo.rb

You will find more examples of me using rspec to run shell commands here:
