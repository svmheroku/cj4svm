#
# index_spec.rb
#

# Usage:
# bundle exec rspec index_spec.rb

# I use this script to generate a list of a-tags like this:
# Week: 2011-02-20 Through 2011-02-25

# The a-tags will land in this file:
# ./fx_past/_fx_past_spool.html.erb
# which is a partial in this file:
# ./fx_past/index.haml

# Each a-tag will take me to a set of reports for a specific week.
# The reports will show:
# - Action (buy or sell) summaries
# - pair summaries
# - Details of all predictions

# Here is some haml which serves as a demo of what I want an a-tag to look like:
# %a(href="/fx_past/fx_past_wk2011_02_20")
#   Week: 2011-02-20 Through 2011-02-25

# I use fx_past.sql to get the data via a join of 3 types of tables:
# prices,gains
# gatt-scores
# gattn-scores
